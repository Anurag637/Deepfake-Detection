## 🧠 Introduction

Deepfakes pose a growing threat in digital misinformation, identity fraud, and online security. This project implements a machine learning-based detection system capable of identifying synthetic or manipulated video/image content with high accuracy using facial cues and inconsistencies introduced during generation.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Detecting deepfakes is challenging due to:
- High-quality synthetic face generation
- Variability in resolution, compression, and lighting
- Similarity in facial behavior and expressions

This project aims to address these challenges through a carefully designed ML pipeline and data-driven training approach.

(Results may vary based on dataset and model used.)

⚠️ Limitations
Sensitive to low-resolution and high-compression media

Faces must be clearly visible for accurate detection

Generalization can be limited if trained on biased datasets

🌱 Future Work
Incorporate audio-based deepfake detection

Implement multi-modal analysis (video + audio)

Use transformers for temporal modeling in videos

Deploy as a real-time web service with Flask/Streamlit
