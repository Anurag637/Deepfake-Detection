## 🧠 Introduction

Deepfakes pose a growing threat in digital misinformation, identity fraud, and online security. This project implements a machine learning-based detection system capable of identifying synthetic or manipulated video/image content with high accuracy using facial cues and inconsistencies introduced during generation.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Detecting deepfakes is challenging due to:
- High-quality synthetic face generation
- Variability in resolution, compression, and lighting
- Similarity in facial behavior and expressions

This project aims to address these challenges through a carefully designed ML pipeline and data-driven training approach.

🔬 Model Pipeline
Preprocessing: Extract frames (from videos), detect and crop faces, normalize.

Modeling: Uses pre-trained ResNet, Xception, or EfficientNet models fine-tuned for binary classification.

Training: Loss functions like Binary Cross Entropy; optimizers like Adam.

Inference: Supports batch processing and real-time video feed.

⚙️ Technology Stack
Language: Python 3.7+

Libraries: PyTorch / TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Web (optional): Streamlit or Flask for demo UI

Hardware Support: GPU (CUDA) recommended for training

AUC	0.98
(Results may vary based on dataset and model used.)

⚠️ Limitations
Sensitive to low-resolution and high-compression media

Faces must be clearly visible for accurate detection

Generalization can be limited if trained on biased datasets

🌱 Future Work
Incorporate audio-based deepfake detection

Implement multi-modal analysis (video + audio)

Use transformers for temporal modeling in videos

Deploy as a real-time web service with Flask/Streamlit

Let me know if you'd like:
- This exported as a `README.md` file
- A version customized for a paper submission or demo
- To add badges (build, license, accuracy, etc.)

Want to convert this into a UI with Streamlit or Flask? I can help with that too.
